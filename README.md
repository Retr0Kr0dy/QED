## What ?

Electro magnetic fields propagation study. (Interaction between electric and magnetic fields as describe by Maxwell's equations.)

## How ?

Using Maxwell's equations such as describe [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations)

## Why ?

Deep understanding of radio signals, light propagtaion, general physics.
